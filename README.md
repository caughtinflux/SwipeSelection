SwipeSelection
==============

An improvement to iOS's text editing that allows you to move the cursor and select text using gestures on the keyboard itself.


This fork removes the feature(?) that added selections from the delete key too, and stops deletion of text when a swipe starts from backspace, albeit using an ugly hack
Yes, really, that's the /only/ reason this fork exists.
